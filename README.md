# Robert's Resume Generator

This is my resume, written in a combination of YAML & Go. Rather than keep various
versions of my resume available for different situations (career, volunteering, etc),
I decided to rewrite my entire resume in YAML and then to use Go to generate whichever
version of a resume I need. As of right now, I can only generate my career resume,
though I intend to add more functionality to eventually generate other versions
as necessary.

My resume and software are all open source, so feel free to use this repository
as a guideline for how you may want to implement your own resume generation system.
I do ask that you not adopt the entire style of my resume, however. I cannot stop
you from doing so, but please make some changes so your format is distinct from
my own.

As of right now, this generator does **not** work with the resume JSON Spec. That
may be a future feature addition.
